      <description>A few years ago, after deciding to build my own mechanical keyboard and shopping around for a while attempting the near impossible task of choosing one build from the infinite combinations of parts available, I finally chose to build an OLKB Planck. This post explains the thoughts that went into building it as well as the parts used and layouts.
The Motive One of the main reasons I went the full custom route was to better allow customization of my keyboard&amp;rsquo;s layout.</description>

      <description>Isaac 2 is a text adventure game I worked on over the summer of 2020. I originally got the idea to make a text adventure game after playing Stories Untold. The main gameplay element in that game was you playing an ever unfolding story but interacting with each &amp;ldquo;chapter&amp;rdquo; via different game genres. One chapter would be a puzzle game, the next one a first person horror, and one of them was a text adventure.</description>
