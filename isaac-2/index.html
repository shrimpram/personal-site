<p>Isaac 2 is a text adventure game I worked on over the summer of 2020. I
originally got the idea to make a text adventure game after playing
<a href="https://storiesuntoldgame.com">Stories Untold</a>. The main gameplay
element in that game was you playing an ever unfolding story but
interacting with each &quot;chapter&quot; via different game genres. One chapter
would be a puzzle game, the next one a first person horror, and one of
them was a text adventure. All of these seamlessly tied together into
one big story. What originally surprised me was how well each different
chapter was made, not just from a story point of view but from a
gameplay perspective. The game felt good to play if that makes any
sense? Puzzles were rewarding, first person horror kept me on the edge
of my seat, and most of all, the text adventure was such a unique medium
for both storytelling and gameplay that I felt I had to try it out.</p>
<h2>It would be like creating my own D&amp;D adventure</h2>
<p>Is what I thought when I first decided on making a text adventure game.
Having players explore a world, that I built solely through my words,
painting a picture in their minds of the atmosphere without relying on
graphics. Don't get me wrong, modern day graphics are amazing, and some
games--especially those with unique art styles--are improved
tremendously by their graphics that help immerse you in the world. That,
however, was out of my scope for making this game as I had neither the
time, resources, nor knowledge to create graphics at a level that would
satisfy me. So I settled for making my game solely through text, with no
fancy 3D graphics.</p>
<h2>I don't know how to code</h2>
<p>After deciding that I wanted to make a text adventure, my next major
hurdle was figuring out how to actually make one. The last game I
made--The Birth of Isaac--was made using <a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com">RPG Maker
MV</a>, a program that let you make RPG games
without needing to know code. I still didn't know how to code so I would
have to find another such program. I looked through dozens of bloated
programs with UIs that reminded me of games I would rent from my library
until finally I settled on <a href="http://inform7.com">Inform 7</a>.</p>
<p>Inform 7 isn't so much a program as it is a language. Specifically, what
Inform does is let you &quot;program&quot; text adventure games using the English
language as syntax. Instead of setting up a bunch of complex variables,
you simply write out what you want to happen in English and Inform
processes it into playable output. For example, say you wanted there to
be a Kitchen with a spoon inside a drawer the player could open. You
would simply write</p>
<pre><code>The Kitchen is a room.

Drawer is a container in The Kitchen. Drawer is openable and fixed in place. Drawer is closed.

Spoon is a thing inside Drawer. The description of spoon is &quot;A shiny spoon, you can see your reflection in the back.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is as simple as code gets, it's almost as if you're having a
conversation with your computer and describing your game to it. Inform
also has a great community that has made plugins for it which allow you
to save quite a lot of time. For this game, I used the &quot;Conversation
Framework&quot; plugin by Eric Eve to make dialogue very easy to set up.
Through inform I was able to put my thoughts and ideas into a playable
game format without much hassle.</p>
<h2>Endless Dilemma</h2>
<p>Now I had the means to make the game, I had Inform figured out and I was
ready to start. The only problem was I had no idea what kind of game I
wanted to make. The game format did not help me either. Other game
formats, like RPG's or FPS' have relatively strict guidelines as to what
games in that genre can be. With text adventure, there were no limits, I
could quite literally make any game I could think of. With this freedom
also came the drawback of having to decide from that very infinite pool
of possible games. Originally, I was in the process of making a slice of
life game, where the player would do tasks and interact with people with
no real plot behind it. But I quickly realized that this was on the fun
scale right with reading textbooks and vacuuming. So as quickly as that
project started, I pressed Control+a delete.</p>
<p>I decided that instead of rushing to quickly start making a playable
game it would be best to stop and figure everything out first.
Coincidentally, I was in the middle of a playthrough of <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire">LA
Noire</a>, a detective game set in
1940's Los Angeles. It involved a quite unique game system, with the
typical level progression involving 1. Going around the crime scene to
find clues 2. Traveling to locations and questioning witnesses, using
your clues to find flaws in their testimonies 3. Coming to a conclusion
using your evidence and accusing someone. The nature of the clues
finding and interrogations really interested me, it made me feel like I
was the one doing the detective work. Instead of having to randomly
point and click until something finally registered in the game I could
use logic and the information I had to solve the mystery. Given how much
I liked playing LA Noire I thought it would be great to make a text
adventure game based on the same core gameplay principles. Players would
walk around looking for clues, then piece them together along with
conversations with NPCs in order to solve the mystery of CG's death. And
so, Isaac 2 took shape.</p>
<h2>Burnout, Not the Car Kind</h2>
<p>As I started working on Isaac 2, the weeks disappeared as quickly as a
dropped pen, and all of a sudden it was nearing the end of the year.
Now, after working on this game for almost half a year, I was getting
bored. To put it frankly, I was sick of doing the same stuff every day,
booting up my computer just to open the same file and edit the same
code. I needed something new. And so that's exactly what I did; I took a
break. Taking breaks is essential in the creative process, a lesson I
learned from this second endeavor. Isaac 1 I had managed to finish in
one stretch of work, not taking any breaks, but since Isaac 2 was a much
bigger project I knew that for the sake of both my mental health and the
quality of the game I needed some time off. Now, taking time off doesn't
necessarily mean to just leave the project and never think about it. As
I went about other things Isaac 2 was still in the back of my mind, be
that in small features I noticed in other games I wanted to implement,
certain writing styles in books that I thought could be interesting to
use, or even other things that I thought would be funny easter eggs to
add. Taking a break meant not dedicating myself to work on that game,
but it didn't mean forgetting it entirely, that was the key difference.</p>
<p>Coming back after my break, I got back into the game with newfound
energy, finishing up what was left of the project. Taking a break was
definitely crucial to Isaac 2, I feel that if I hadn't taken that time
off I would have just rushed to finish the project and be done with it
instead of actually making a game that lived up to my expectations.
Originally, I had planned to release it like I had released other games,
by just sharing a copy of all the files, but in the end I found out that
with Inform I could release the game as a playable html page, then host
that for free on GitHub. Plus I had the added benefit of being able to
roll out patches at any time and not have to &quot;re-release&quot; the game.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Isaac 2 was a very fun project, and I got to learn about a ton of
different game formats while exploring its possibilities. Text Adventure
games are often overlooked as being basic or bland, especially with all
the new flashy games out there that make use of modern hardware. But,
what these games lack in pizazz, they more than make up in their charm.
There's a certain feel you get when inputting text and seeing your
player character do things, almost like you yourself are in that
adventure. Plus, good authors can use the limitations of this genre to
their advantage, helping the player imagine sprawling cities and ornate
landscapes in their minds. The &quot;graphics card&quot; in this case is the
player themselves, and that comes with its own advantages and
disadvantages. If you're new to the genre and have never really played a
text adventure game I'd highly recommend at least checking one of them
out, they will definitely surprise you.</p>
